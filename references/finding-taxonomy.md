# Finding taxonomy

## Severity

| Severity | Meaning | Action |
|---|---|---|
| High | Meaning, safety, requirement force, or execution can change | Stop or ask before rewriting |
| Medium | A reader can misunderstand the actor, action, condition, or result | Rewrite before delivery |
| Low | The text is correct but longer, noisier, or less consistent than needed | Fix when it improves the result |
| Advisory | A heuristic found a possible issue that needs human judgment | Review in context |

## Categories and IDs

| Prefix | Category | Typical findings |
|---|---|---|
| SEM | Semantic integrity | changed modality, missing condition, invented actor, dropped exception |
| WRD | Word choice | vague word, unstable term, unapproved high-frequency term, jargon |
| VRB | Verbs and voice | passive voice, nominalization, complex tense, weak primary verb |
| SEN | Sentences | over limit, contraction, omitted word, multiple instructions |
| STR | Structure | mixed topic, long paragraph, buried result, list needed |
| SAF | Safety | wrong risk label, missing command, missing consequence |
| PUN | Punctuation | semicolon, unclear hyphenation, dense parentheses |
| PRO | Pronouns | ambiguous antecedent, unclear `this` |
| AIP | AI prose | throat-clearing, hype, canned transition, repetition, fake certainty |
| LIT | Literal integrity | changed code, identifier, URL, number, unit, or quotation |

## Readiness score

The score measures style readiness, not certification.

Start at 100 and deduct:

- 20 for each unresolved high finding;
- 8 for each medium finding;
- 2 for each low finding;
- 0 for an advisory finding until human review confirms it.

Do not report a score below zero. A high score does not prove dictionary
compliance.
