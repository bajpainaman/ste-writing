Optional source files on the authoring Mac:

- PDF: `/Users/namanbajpai/Downloads/ASD-STE100_ISSUE9.pdf`
- Markdown OCR: `/Users/namanbajpai/ocr/output/ASD-STE100_ISSUE9/ASD-STE100_ISSUE9.md`
- Raw OCR JSON: `/Users/namanbajpai/ocr/output/ASD-STE100_ISSUE9/ASD-STE100_ISSUE9.json`
- Figure annotations:

The skill does not require these files. A Linux installation uses the condensed
rules and references in the skill package.

The full book received through Taildrop on 2026-09-29 is available locally,
relative to this repository:

- Markdown: `vale/private/ASD-STE100_ISSUE9.md`
- Original archive: `vale/private/ASD-STE100_ISSUE9.zip`
- Extracted dictionary and restrictions: `vale/private/dictionary.json`

These files are Git-ignored. The Markdown matches the archive member byte for
byte. [The Vale package](../vale/README.md) documents the extraction audit and
its unresolved count discrepancy. [The coverage map](../vale/coverage.md)
records all 53 rules, their source locations, and remaining contextual review.

The OCR result contains 434 unique page indexes, no empty OCR pages, 7 extracted
figures, and 4,508 Markdown table rows.

## Efficient verification

Use this section only when the optional Markdown source is present. Do not load
the full 698 KB file for a normal rewrite. Search first:

```bash
rg -n -i 'Rule 5\\.1|procedural writing|maximum of 20 words' \
  /Users/namanbajpai/ocr/output/ASD-STE100_ISSUE9/ASD-STE100_ISSUE9.md
```

Read a bounded region around the match:

```bash
sed -n '3826,3940p' \
  /Users/namanbajpai/ocr/output/ASD-STE100_ISSUE9/ASD-STE100_ISSUE9.md
```

## Scope and rights

The public package contains condensed study notes, original implementation
guidance, and linter code. It excludes the full standard, source archive,
extracted dictionary, and generated full-dictionary scripts. Keep those source
materials in the Git-ignored `vale/private/` directory. The code's MIT license
does not grant rights to redistribute the standard.

Use the official document for regulated work. Do not present OCR or these notes as
an official edition.
